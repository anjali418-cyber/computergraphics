# Virtual Classroom using 3D Transformations and Clipping

This project demonstrates a simple 3D virtual classroom using Python, PyOpenGL, and GLUT. It showcases 3D transformations (rotation, translation, scaling) and will include clipping techniques.

## Features
- 3D classroom scene (walls, floor, desks, board, avatars)
- Camera controls (orbit with mouse drag, zoom with +/-)
- Demonstrates 3D transformations
- Ready for further extension (clipping, more UI, etc)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyOpenGL
- PyOpenGL_accelerate

## Installation
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Project
```
python main.py
```

## Controls
- Mouse drag: Orbit camera
- + / - : Zoom in/out
- q or Esc: Quit

## To Do
- Add clipping plane demonstration
- Add more interactive classroom features
