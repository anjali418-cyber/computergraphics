# Problem Understanding: 3D Virtual Classroom

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to design and implement a 3D Virtual Classroom scene. This involves:
- Creating a 3D environment representing a typical classroom.
- Populating the classroom with basic elements such as desks, chairs, a chalkboard, and simple student/teacher avatars.
- Implementing 3D transformations (translation, rotation, scaling) for object placement and camera manipulation.
- Demonstrating 3D clipping techniques.
- Providing interactive camera controls to navigate the scene.

## Key Requirements

- **3D Scene Construction**: Model a classroom with identifiable components.
- **3D Transformations**: Utilize matrix transformations for positioning objects and the camera.
- **Camera System**: Implement an interactive camera (e.g., orbit, zoom) to view the scene from different perspectives.
- **Lighting**: Apply basic lighting to enhance the 3D perception of the scene.
- **Clipping**: Implement and demonstrate 3D clipping planes or volumes.
- **Interaction**: Allow user interaction for camera control.

## Initial Technical Approach

The project was initially planned to be developed using Python with the PyOpenGL library for OpenGL graphics rendering. FreeGLUT was chosen for window management, event handling, and drawing basic geometric primitives.
